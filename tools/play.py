"""Signing, bundling and uploading the Android app to Google Play, for .github/workflows/play.yml.

One command per step of that workflow, in the order it runs them, the way tools/testflight.py
does it for iOS:

  check-secrets    Say whether the Play secrets are all set. A missing one is not an error here:
                   the step's `configured` output turns the rest of the job off, so a release
                   round still ships to TestFlight while the Play Console is being set up.
  paths            Where the upload key, the service account key and the bundle live on this runner.
  settings         Read the application id out of android.gradle and MARKETING_VERSION out of
                   Config.xcconfig; the bundle carries the same version as the iOS build.
  install-signing  Write the upload keystore and the service account key out of the secrets.
  bundle           `gradle bundleRelease`, signed with the upload key and stamped with the
                   run number as versionCode. R8 writes the mapping file next to it.
  upload           Send the bundle and its mapping file to the closed testing track through the
                   Play Developer API.
  cleanup          Remove the key material from the runner.

The Play Developer API is called with the standard library and `openssl`, which signs the
service account's JWT: no client library to install on the runner. One-time setup and the
list of secrets: docs/play.md
